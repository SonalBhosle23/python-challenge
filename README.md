# python-challenge PyBank
We were asked to create Python script to analyse the financial records of a given company via a financial dataset called budget_data.csv.
The dataset had two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

A Python script was required to analyse the records to calculate each of the following values:

total number of months included in the dataset,net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period,changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and greatest increase/decrease in profits
The script is as follows:
# import os

# import csv
# Open and read csv


# Assign variables  


# Calculate the total number of votes cast

# Print Election result analysis

Financial Analysis
-----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $ 22564198
Average Change: $ -8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits:Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits:Feb-14 ($-1825558)

# Export the results to a text file

    
# print result in an output file
